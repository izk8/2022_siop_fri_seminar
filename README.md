# Additional Resources

## Additional Programming Languages and Analysis Tools

During the seminar, we shared coding examples and details on both R and Python. Here are some other programming languages and tools that are sometimes used for machine learning.

* Excel
* AnalyzeIt - Excel package turn Excel into SPSS 
* SPSS
* SPSS Modeler
* SAS
* Julia
* Apache

There are also several IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that can be helpful for making your experience working with R or python smoother. For R, RStudio is the most common IDE. There are multiple options for Python including Pycharm, Spyder, and VScode. Also programs like Sublime and Notepad++ can also display formatted code. 

Notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks or R markdown are also helpful for displaying code and results and for sharing your results with others.

## Vendor Services

Another route that organizations sometimes take is using a vendor that offers drag and drop style machine learning services. These services often come with dashboards and common models pre-built and ready for use. 

Common vendors include:

* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Watson
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
