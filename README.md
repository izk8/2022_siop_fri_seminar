# SIOP 2022 Machine Learning Friday Seminar

**Thanks for attending this seminar! This Github contains additional resources for you along with the code from today's session.**

# Additional Resources

## Useful Packages for R
* Tidyverse (Suite of tools for data wrangling and manipulation)
* Tidymodels (Suite of tools for using ML models within the tidyverse)
* Caret (ML models)
* Psych (statistics commonly used in psychology)
* Swirl (to learn R)

## Tidymodeling
There are a ton of great resources for learning tidymodeling. I highly suggest you try out the following to get you started.
* https://www.tidymodels.org/
* https://www.tmwr.org/

## Useful Packages for Python

* SKLearn (ML models, this package has excellent documentation as well)
* Pandas (used for data manipulation in python)
* numpy (package that contains mathematical functions needed for ML) 


## Additional Programming Languages and Analysis Tools

During the seminar, we shared coding examples and details on both R and Python. Here are some other programming languages and tools that are sometimes used for machine learning.

* Excel
* AnalyzeIt - Excel package turn Excel into SPSS 
* SPSS
* SPSS Modeler
* SAS
* Julia
* Apache

There are also several IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that can be helpful for making your experience working with R or python smoother. For R, RStudio is the most common IDE. There are multiple options for Python including Pycharm, Spyder, and VScode. Also programs like Sublime and Notepad++ can also display formatted code. 

Notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks or R markdown are also helpful for displaying code and results and for sharing your results with others.

## Vendor Services

Another route that organizations sometimes take is using a vendor that offers drag and drop style machine learning services. These services often come with dashboards and common models pre-built and ready for use. 

Common vendors include:

* Microsoft Azure
* IBM Watson
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
